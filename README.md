### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a molecular biologist and systems neuroscientist with a passion for data science! This Github profile is partially meant to highlight some notable past projects as well as what I am working on at the moment. I'm interested in learning new concepts while developing my skill set. In my free time I enjoy being with my family, exercising, traveling, and ocasionally video gaming.  

Check out my [portfolio](https://github.com/sean-otoole/Portfolio) to see some of the projects I've worked on.
