### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a molecular biologist, systems neuroscientist, and data scientist! This Github page is largely meant to highlight some notable past projects as well as what I am working on at the moment. I'm interested in learning new concepts, developing my skill set, and making impactful contributions to healthcare. In my free time, I enjoy being with my family, exercising, traveling, and occasionally video gaming.

Please be advised, that the commit history does not fully reflect my coding experience, as much of my work was previoiusly done with private subversion repositories.

Check out my [personal website](https://sean-otoole.github.io/) to see some of the projects I've worked on.
