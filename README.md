### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a molecular biologist and systems neuroscientist who is currently transitioning into a career in data science! In my free time, I like to spend time with my family, exercise, travel, and ocasionally some video gaming.  

Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/sean-otoole/Portfolio) for some of my projects.
