### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the github page for Sean O'Toole.

At the moment this is a work in progress, many missing files and explanations to be written in the README files for each repository.

In addition to current projects, this page is here to highligh the analysis code I've written for past projects as a postdoctoral fellow and Ph.D. student.
