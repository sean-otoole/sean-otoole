### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a molecular biologist and systems neuroscientist who is currently transitioning towards a career in data science!

Welcome to my github page!!!

At the moment it is very much a work in progress, i.e. many missing files and explanations still need to be added or written for each repository.

In addition to current projects, this page github serves to highlight the analysis code I've written for past projects as a postdoctoral fellow and Ph.D. student.
